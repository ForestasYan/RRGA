Development of Range Resonance Genetic Algorithm

The aim is to improve on traditional Genetic Algorithms by add a new "hoxgene" whose role is to find dependencies  in multiple variable functions.
In this case, we are looking for the minimum of different functions such as the Rastrigin and Rosenbrock functions.
